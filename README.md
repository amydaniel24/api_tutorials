- `weather_project/`  
  A project on working with a WeatherAPI:

  - `sample_weather_data.csv`

## How to run

1. Open this repo in VS Code.
2. Open any `.ipynb` notebook.
3. Select your Python kernel (the one that has pandas/requests installed).
4. Run the cells from top to bottom.

## Notes

The weather project calls a real API, so it requires an API key.
